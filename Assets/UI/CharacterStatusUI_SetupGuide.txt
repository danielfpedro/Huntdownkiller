Character Status UI Setup Guide
===============================

This guide shows how to set up the Character Status UI for health and stamina bars.

1. Create a Canvas:
   - Right-click in Hierarchy → UI → Canvas
   - Set Canvas Scaler to "Scale With Screen Size"
   - Reference Resolution: 1920x1080 (or your target resolution)

2. Create Health Bar:
   - Right-click on Canvas → UI → Image (name it "HealthBar")
   - Set Color to red/green
   - Add another Image as child (name it "HealthBarFill")
   - Set HealthBarFill Image Type to "Filled"
   - Set Fill Method to "Horizontal"
   - Set Fill Origin to "Left"

3. Create Stamina Bar:
   - Right-click on Canvas → UI → Image (name it "StaminaBar")
   - Set Color to blue/yellow
   - Add another Image as child (name it "StaminaBarFill")
   - Set StaminaBarFill Image Type to "Filled"
   - Set Fill Method to "Horizontal"
   - Set Fill Origin to "Left"

4. Position the bars:
   - Place them in corners (e.g., bottom-left for health, bottom-right for stamina)
   - Adjust sizes as needed

5. Create UI Manager GameObject:
   - Create empty GameObject (name it "UIManager")
   - Attach the CharacterStatusUI script
   - Drag your player GameObject to "Player Target"
   - Drag the HealthBarFill Image to "Health Bar Fill"
   - Drag the StaminaBarFill Image to "Stamina Bar Fill"

6. Health System Integration:
   - The UI script includes methods to update health:
     - SetHealth(float health)
     - TakeDamage(float damage)
     - Heal(float amount)
   - Call these from your damage/health system

Example usage in damage script:
```csharp
// Get reference to UI manager
CharacterStatusUI statusUI = FindObjectOfType<CharacterStatusUI>();

// When taking damage
statusUI.TakeDamage(25f);

// When healing
statusUI.Heal(50f);
```

The stamina bar automatically updates from the PlayerMovement component!
